# factorio-space-start

## Ideas
- ~~Start with a space platform~~
- ~~Have some initial items~~
- ~~No planet surfaces unlocked initially~~
- Begin in orbit of the star, not in orbit of any planet (new location on starmap)
- A few technologies to be unlocked at the start: Advanced Asteroid Processing, Coal Synthesis, Simple Coal Liquefaction
- Adjust necessary space technologies to enable smooth research
- ~~Every asteroid crushing recipe produces some stone~~
- ~~A new furnace that runs on thruster fuel and thruster oxidizer~~
- Ensure compatibility with [Inter Platform Logistics] (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Inter-Platform-Logistics)
- ~~Require a new research to drop to a planet~~ (This is not necessary if you don't start at a planet and have to research planet discovery to reach nauvis)
