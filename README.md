## Ideas
- ~~Start with a space platform~~
- Have some initial items
- ~~No planet surfaces unlocked initially~~
- Begin in orbit of the star, not in orbit of any planet (new location on starmap)
- A few technologies to be unlocked at the start: Advanced Asteroid Processing, Coal Synthesis, Simple Coal Liquefaction
- Adjust necessary space technologies to enable smooth research
- Every asteroid crushing recipe produces some stone
- A new furnace that runs on thruster fuel and thruster oxidizer
- Ensure compatibility with [Inter Platform Logistics] (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Inter-Platform-Logistics)
- Require a new research to drop to a planet
